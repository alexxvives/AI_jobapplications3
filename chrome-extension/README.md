## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

### Smart Field Detection

The extension uses advanced semantic matching to identify form fields:

- **Label text analysis**: Matches field labels to your profile data
- **Placeholder text**: Uses placeholder hints to understand field purpose
- **Field attributes**: Analyzes HTML attributes like `name` and `id`
- **Context awareness**: Considers surrounding text and form structure

### Intelligent Form Filling

- **Text fields**: Fills name, email, phone, address, etc.
- **Select dropdowns**: Matches options for experience, education level, etc.
- **Checkboxes**: Handles yes/no questions and preferences
- **File uploads**: Shows notification for resume uploads (manual step)

### Privacy & Security

- **Local storage only**: All data stored in Chrome's local storage
- **No external tracking**: No analytics or tracking scripts
- **Secure communication**: Backend imports use secure HTTPS
- **User control**: You control what data is stored and used
