 Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer role at RocketLaunch Labs. With over three years of experience building dynamic, user-friendly interfaces in React, I’m confident in my ability to contribute to your team’s mission of delivering impactful web experiences.

At TechCorp Inc., I built and maintained key React components for our internal dashboard, working closely with designers to ensure a responsive and visually polished product. This collaborative environment taught me the value of clean code and consistent UI — skills I know are valued at RocketLaunch Labs.

I’m particularly drawn to your company’s startup energy and fast-paced environment. My ability to iterate quickly and communicate effectively has helped me thrive in similar contexts, and I’d love to bring that momentum to your engineering team.

Thank you for considering my application. I’d be thrilled to contribute to RocketLaunch Labs’ success and would welcome the opportunity to chat further.

Sincerely,  
John Doe
