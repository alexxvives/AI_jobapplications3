# UI Update Summary - Comprehensive Company Sources Display

## üéØ What Was Updated

I've updated the UI to display comprehensive statistics from our consolidated company sources and job extraction data.

---

## üìä Backend Changes

### 1. **New Company Statistics Module** (`/backend/company_stats.py`)
- Loads consolidated companies data (583 companies)
- Provides comprehensive statistics by source and platform
- Integrates with database for actual job extraction results

### 2. **Enhanced API Endpoint** (`/backend/main.py`)
- Updated `/jobs/stats` to return comprehensive data
- Added legacy endpoint `/jobs/stats/simple` for backward compatibility

---

## üé® Frontend Changes

### 1. **Enhanced Dashboard** (`/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`)

#### **New Summary Cards:**
- **Available Companies:** 583 (total companies in consolidated database)
- **Jobs Found:** Shows actual jobs extracted from scraping
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of companies successfully scraped
- **Scraped Companies:** Number of companies with jobs found

#### **Company Sources Breakdown:**
Shows statistics from all consolidated sources:
- `shared_companies` (409 companies - the "tekhycommon" list)
- `csv_workday`, `csv_adp`, `csv_lever`, `csv_workable` (CSV files)
- `ats_*` sources (25 different ATS platform JSON files)

#### **Platform Performance:**
Real-time job extraction statistics by platform:
- Workday: X jobs from Y companies
- Lever: X jobs from Y companies  
- ADP: X jobs from Y companies
- And 20+ other platforms

#### **Top Performing Companies Table:**
Shows the companies yielding the most jobs:
- Company name
- Platform used
- Number of jobs found

#### **Updated Features Description:**
Now mentions "25+ ATS platforms" and "583+ companies" instead of just "Ashby, Greenhouse, and Lever"
