# UI Fix Summary - Jobs Found & Source Breakdown

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Jobs Found showing 0**
- **Problem:** Backend was looking for a different database structure 
- **Solution:** Updated `company_stats.py` to connect to the actual scraping database (`multi_platform_jobs.db`)
- **Result:** Now correctly shows **215 total jobs** from scraping results

### 2. **Missing Source-by-Source Breakdown**
- **Problem:** Lost the original simple display of jobs per source
- **Solution:** Added `get_simple_job_stats_by_source()` function and new UI section
- **Result:** Shows jobs by source like before: **Workday: 182 jobs**, **Lever: 33 jobs**
